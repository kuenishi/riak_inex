# Riak Import/Export

Though we already have `riak-admin backup/restore` , we don't have a
good tool to import general formats like CSV or JSON. This tool does
it.

## Build and prepare

To build and run this tool, Erlang/OTP is required.

```
$ which erl
/path/to/bin/erl
$ git clone git://github.com/kuenishi/riak_inex.git
$ cd riak_inex
$ make
```

## Run

Riak should be running.

```
$ ./inex localhost 8087 yourbucket data.csv
```

Example:

```
$ ./inex localhost 8087 b priv/sample.csv
connecting "localhost" 8087, to import "priv/sample.csv"
2 lines imported.
```

## Check

To see your data properly imported, query to Riak:

```
$ curl 'http://localhost:8098/buckets/b/keys?keys=true'
```

This will take proportional to number of lines.

# Relasenotes 0.0.1

- CSV support as each line for each value and keys automatically
  generated by Riak.
